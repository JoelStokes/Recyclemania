## Introduction

Originally created in 2016 during the [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) Game Design & Development Club's Spring Break Jam for the ODU [Recycling Department](https://www.odu.edu/life/sustainable/recycling).

The original concept was meant to be a collection of recycling-themed minigames that would eventually be turned into a campus app, however plans eventually broke down after the initial prototypes due to feasibility issues communicating with the Recycling Department & complexity of hosting applications under the ODU name.

The files in this project is the individual minigame I created, and have rebooted 5 years later to polish it for my game development portfolio.

## How To Play

The game in playable [Here at Itch.io](https://jstokesgames.itch.io/recyclemania)!

Simply click and drap materials from the conveyor belt into the crusher, then tap the lever to crush! The longer you go with correct crushes, the higher your score multiplier will go!

Although the Itch.io build can be played on mobile, WebGL is not supported on older mobile devices, so gameplay quality could vary depending on device age.
