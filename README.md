# Recyclemania
## Introduction

Originally created in 2016 during the [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) Game Design & Development Club's Spring Break Jam for the ODU [Recycling Department](https://www.odu.edu/life/sustainable/recycling).

The original concept was meant to be a collection of recycling-themed minigames that would eventually be turned into a campus app, however plans eventually broke down after the initial prototypes due to feasibility issues communicating with the Recycling Department & complexity of hosting applications under the ODU name.

The files in this project is the individual minigame I created, and have rebooted 5 years later to polish it for my game development portfolio.
